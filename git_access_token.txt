Actually what you did there is setting up the author information, just for the commits. You didn't store the credentials. credentials can be stored in 2 ways:

using the git credential functions: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store
change the origin url to "https://username:password@github.com".
a third alternative is to use an ssh key (as @StephenKitt said). For github configuration, you can find all needed information in GitHub help page
