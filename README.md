# Testing the Flask Server
The flask server can run locally using the following command:

FLASK_APP="app.py" flask run --host=0.0.0.0

#This is the simulation branch
simply run simulate_xmas.py or whatever it is from the commandline
and it will randomize lists until in finds one with the least errors
